#LoLTracker

###THIS IS AN OUT OF DATE VERSION

######I'm extremely close to an alpha version of this application - as soon as it is finished it will be available here as an executable jar

__________________________________________________________________________________________
A multi-funtional tool for tracking friends and generating statistics in League of Legends by utilising Riot Game's API.
Once you download the app, just run it once a day after you play your games (or after every game, I'm not your mother) and it will access and catalogue your games. By building up a large pool of games that you/your friends/whoever you want to track has played, you will be able to look at patterns, tendencies, and generate statistics.

##WHEN YOU ARE DONE, MAKE SURE YOU TYPE QUIT - OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT SAVE THE DATA AND YOU'LL HAVE TO RETRIEVE IT ALL OVER AGAIN

Currently only available as a text-based interface.
__________________________________________________________________________________________
<b><u>Upcoming features:</b></u>
- ability to discover statistics through a custom query engine
- current game summary
- summary of any player's 10 most recent games
- link generator to allow you to access the raw JSON returned from Riot API calls
- ability to view statistics of items and champions, not just players
- an actual GUI!
- verbose output (more of a reminder to me for debugging help than for anyone else)
